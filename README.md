# Python-api-Challenge
## Part I - WeatherPy

In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Your first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.

Your second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression is modeling such as any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have.

Your final notebook must:

* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.

* **Note:** Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out [Google Maps Platform Billing](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing/gmp-billing#monitor-and-restrict-consumption) and [Manage your cost of use](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage-and-billing#set-caps) for more information.

* **Note:** if you having trouble displaying the maps try running `jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps` in your environment and retry.

* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the homework.

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

  * **Note:** Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.

* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.

As final considerations:

* Create a new GitHub repository for this project called `API-Challenge` (note the kebab-case). **Do not add to an existing repo**
* You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
* For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.
